<h1>ISN section website</h1>
<p class='main_para'>
	This project was my end of studies' IT project at High school of Briançon. I had to add dynamism over <a href="http://isnalti.free.fr/" target="_blank">an existing static website</a> using PHP and MySql<br>
	I had 3 objectives : <br>1- Create a connexion system, with account rankings
	<br>2- Restrain some ressources of the websites with those rankings
	<br>3- Create forums of communication
	<br><br>
	All those objectives has been accomplished. And even if the dynamic version hasn't been uploaded, i learned a lot from this project.<br>
