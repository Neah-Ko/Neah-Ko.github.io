<h1>Iter mini robots contest (2013)</h1>
<p class='main_para'>
	I took part of this project during my 1st year in high school in mini-robots option, it was about building a robot using 
	<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms" target="_blank">mindstorm NXT</a> technologies. Our robot has to do a simulation of maintenance of the Tokamak of 
	<a href="https://www.iter.org/" target="_blank">ITER</a> project.<br> As a team of 7 we had to build and code the robot for it to move independently and fetch for 
	5 little red bricks disposed on the model and bring them back at start point.
